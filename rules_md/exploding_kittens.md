# Exploding Kittens 

PLAYERS: 2-5
CONTENTS: 56 CARDS ORIGINAL EDITION

In the deck of cards are some Exploding Kittens. You play the game by putting the deck face down and taking turns drawing cards until someone draws an Exploding Kitten.
When that happens, that person explodes and they are out of the game All of the other cards will give you powerful tools to help you avoid exploding! This process continues until there’s only  1 player left who wins the game.

BASICALLY if you explode, you lose. and you are full of incendiary loser sadsauce. if you don’t explode, YOU WIN. and you are full of greatness. good job, buddy. and all of the other cards will lessen your chances of getting  exploded by Exploding Kittens.


## %SETUP 
1. To start, remove all the Exploding Kittens (4) from the deck and set them aside. 
2. Remove all of the Defuses (6) from the deck and deal 1 to each player.  NOTE: Depending on how many people are playing, there will be some Defuses left over. Shuffle 2 of the extras back into the deck, and remove them from the game. (In the case of a 5 player game, you’ll only have 1 extra Defuse to shuffle back into the deck.)
3. Shuffle the deck and deal 7 cards face down to each player. Everyone now has a hand of 8 cards total.  (7 cards + 1 Defuse). Look at your cards but keep them secret. 
4. Insert enough Exploding Kittens back into the deck so that there is 1 fewer than the number of people playing. Remove any extra Exploding Kittens from the game
5. Shuffle the deck, and put it face down in the middle of the table.
6. Pick a player to go first. (Some sample criteria: most excited to go first, most intimidating odor, shortest spleen, etc.)


## %TAKING YOUR TURN 
1. Gather all 8 of your cards into your hand and look at them. Do one of the following:
PLAY: Play a card from your hand by placing it FACE UP on top of the Discard Pile. Follow the instructions on the card. Read the text on  a card to learn what it does. After you follow the instructions on the card, you can play another card. You can play as many cards as you’d like. OR
PASS: Play no cards.
2. End your turn by drawing a card from the top of the Draw Pile into your hand and hoping it’s not an Exploding Kitten. Play continues clockwise around the table. REMEMBER: Play as many or as few cards as you’d like, then draw a card to end your turn. 


## %ENDING THE GAME: 
Eventually every player will explode except   for one, who wins the game! You won’t ever run out of cards in the Draw Pile because you inserted enough Exploding Kittens   to kill all but 1 player


## %THREE MORE THINGS:
- A good strategy generally is to save your cards early in  the game while your chance of exploding is low. 
- You can always count the cards left in the   Draw Pile to figure out the odds of exploding. 
- There is no maximum or minimum hand size. If you run out of cards in your hand, there’s no special action to take. Keep playing. You’ll draw  at least 1 more card on your next turn


## %CARDS:
- Exploding Kitten (4 Cards): You must show this card immediately. Unless you have a Defuse, you’re dead. When you die, put the kitten that killed you face up in front of you so that everyone can see that you’re dead, and the rest of your cards face down in front of you. 
- Defuse (6 cards): If you drew an Exploding Kitten, you can play this card instead of dying. Place your Defuse in the Discard Pile. Then take the Exploding Kitten, and without  reordering or viewing the other cards, secretly  put it back in the Draw Pile anywhere you’d like. Your turn is over after playing this card.
- Attack x2 (4 cards): End your turn without drawing a card, and immediately force the next player to take 2 turns in a row. If the victim of an Attack plays this card on any of their turns, the attacks “stack” and their turns are immediately transferred to the next player, who must take the Attacker’s current and remaining untaken turn(s) PLUS 2 additional turns. 
- Favor (4 cards): Force any other player to give you 1 card from their hand. They choose which card to give you
- Nope (5 cards): Stop any action except for an Exploding Kitten or a Defuse. It’s as if the card beneath a Nope never existed. You can also play a Nope on another Nope to negate it and create a Yup, and so on. You can play a Nope at any time before an action has begun, even if it’s not your turn. Any cards that have been Noped are lost. Leave them in the Discard Pile. You can even play a Nope on a Special Combo.
- Shuffle (4 cards): Shuffle the Draw Pile until the next player tells you to stop
- Skip (4 cards): Immediately end your turn without drawing  a card. If you play a Skip Card as a defense to an Attack Card, it only ends 1 of the 2 turns. 2 Skip Cards would end both turns.
- see the future 3x (5 cards): Privately view the top 3 cards from the Draw Pile and put them back in the same order. Don’t show the cards to the other players
- Cat cards (4 cards of each of the 5 cats): These cards are powerless on their own, but if you collect any 2 matching Cat Cards, you can play them as a Pair to steal a random card from any player. They can also be used in Special Combos.


## %SPECIAL COMBOS
- TWO of a kind Playing: matching Pairs of Cat Cards (where you get to steal a random card from another player) no longer only applies to pairs of Cat Cards. It now applies to ANY pair of cards with the same title (a pair of Shuffle Cards, a pair of Attack Cards, etc). Ignore the instructions on the cards when you play them as a Special Combo. 
- three of a kind Exactly the same as Two of a Kind, but you get to name the card you want from the other player. If they have it, you get to take it. If not, you get nothing. Ignore the instructions on the cards when you play them as a Special Combo.
