      "you receive 1 resource card for each settlement. You receive 2 resource cards for each city you own that borders that hex. If there are not enough of a given resource in the supply to fulfill everyone’s production, then no one receives any of that resource during that turn (unless it only affects 1 player).2. Trade Y\n",

      "trades below) to gain needed resource cards:\n",
      "a) Domestic Trade Y\n",
      "On your turn, you can trade resource cards with any of the \n",
      "other players. You can announce which resources you need and \n",
      "what you are willing to trade for them. The other players can also make their own proposals and counteroffers.\n",
      "Important: Players may only trade with the player whose turn it is. The other players may not trade among themselves. \n",
      "b) Maritime Trade Y\n",
      "You can also trade without the other players! During your \n",
      "turn, you can always trade at 4:1 by putting 4 identical resource cards back in their stack and taking any 1 resource card of your choice for it. If you have a settlement or city on a harbor Y , you \n",
      "can trade with the bank more favorably: at either a 3:1 ratio or, in certain harbors, at 2:1 (trading the resource type shown).\n",
      "Important: The 4:1 trade is always possible, even if you do not have a settlement on a harbor.\n",
      "3. Build Y\n",
      "Now you can build. Through building, you can increase your \n",
      "victory points Y , expand your road network, improve your \n",
      "resource production, and/or buy useful development cards. To build, you must pay specific combinations of resource cards (see the Building Costs Card Y ). Take the appropriate number \n",
      "of roads, settlements, and/or cities from your supply and place them on the game board. Keep development cards hidden in your hand.\n",
      "You cannot build more pieces than what is available in your \n",
      "pool—a maximum of 5 settlements, 4 cities, and 15 roads.\n",
      "a) Road Y  Requires: Brick & Lumber\n",
      "A new road must always connect to 1 of your existing roads, \n",
      "settlements, or cities. Only 1 road can be \n",
      "built on any given path Y .\n",
      "The first player to build a continuous \n",
      "road (not counting forks) of at least 5 road segments receives the special card “Longest Road Y .” If another player \n",
      "succeeds in building a longer road than the one created by the current owner of the “Longest Road” card, they immediately take the special card (and its 2 victory points). Tip: This creates a 4 victory point swing!\n",

      "If you roll a “7,” no one receives any resources.\n",
      "Instead, every player who has more than 7 resource cards \n",
      "must select half (rounded down) of their resource cards and \n",
      "return them to the bank.\n",
      "Then you must move the robber Y . Proceed as follows:\n",
      "(1) You must move the robber Y  immediately to the number \n",
      "token of any other terrain hex or to the desert Y  hex.(2) Then you steal 1 (random) resource card from an \n",
      "opponent who has a settlement or city adjacent to the target terrain hex. The player who is robbed holds their resource cards face down. You then take 1 card at random. If the target hex is adjacent to 2 or more players’ settlements or cities, you choose which one you want to steal from.\n",
      "Important: If the production number for the hex containing the robber is rolled, the owners of adjacent settlements and cities do not receive resources. The robber prevents it.\n",
      "b) Playing Development Cards Y\n",
      "At any time during your turn, you may play 1 development \n",
      "card (put it face up on the table). That card, however, may not be a card you bought during the same turn (except for a victory point card, as described below)!\n",

      "immediately move the robber. See “Rolling \n",
      "a ‘7’ and Activating the Robber” above and follow steps 1 and 2.\n",
      "Once played, knight cards remain face \n",
      "up in front of you. The first player to have 3 knight cards in front of themself receives the special card “Largest Army,” which is worth 2 victory points. If another player has more knight cards in front of them than the current holder of the Largest Army card, they immediately take the special card and its  2 victory points.\n",

      "You may only reveal them during your turn \n",
      "and when you are sure that you have 10 victory points—that is, to win the game. Of course, you can reveal them after the end of the game if someone else wins. You may play any number of victory point cards during your  turn, even during the turn you purchase them.\n",

      "19 terrain tiles surrounded by ocean. Your goal is to settle on \n",
      "Catan, and expand your territory until it becomes the largest and most glorious in Catan.\n",
      "There are five productive terrain types and one desert on Catan. Each terrain type produces a different type of resource (The \n",
      "desert produces nothing). Each resource you receive is represented by a card. Here’s what each terrain produces:You only collect resources if you own a settlement or city bordering these terrain hexes. In the illustration, the red \n",
      "settlement [A] borders the “10” mountains and orange settlement [B] borders the “10” hills. If a “10” is rolled, the red player receives 1 ore card and the orange player receives 1 brick card.\n",
      "Since the settlements and cities usually border on 2-3 terrain types, they can “harvest” up to 3 different resources based on \n",
      "the dice roll. Here, the white settlement [C] borders on forest, mountains, and pasture. A settlement at [D] would only harvest the production from 2 terrain hexes (hills and mountains). Finally, a settlement at [E] would only harvest the production from 1 terrain hex (pasture). However [E] is also at a wool harbor.\n",
      "Since it’s impossible for you to have settlements adjacent to all terrain hexes and number tokens, you may receive certain \n",
      "resources only at rare intervals—or never. This is tough, because building requires specific resource combinations.\n",
      "For this reason, you can trade with other players. Make them an offer! A successful trade might yield you a big build!\n",
      "You can only build a new settlement on an unoccupied \n",
      "intersection if you have a road leading to that intersection and \n",
      "the nearest settlement is at least two intersections away.\n",
      "Carefully consider where you build settlements. The numbers on the round tokens are depicted in varying sizes. They also \n",
      "have dots (pips) below the numbers. The taller the depicted number, and the more pips it has, the more \n",
      "likely that number is to be \n",

      "are likely to be rolled most \n",

      "To gain more victory points, you must build new roads and \n",
      "settlements and upgrade your settlements to cities. Each city is worth 2 victory points. To build or upgrade, you need to acquire resources.\n",
      "How do you acquire \n",
      "resources? It’s simple. Each turn, you roll 2 dice to determine which terrain hexes produce resources. Each terrain hex is marked with a round number token. If, for example, a “10” is rolled, all terrain hexes with a “10” number token produce resources—in the illustration on the right, those terrain hexes are a mountains  hex (ore) and a hills hex (brick).\n",
